      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to Blogorithm — a space where thoughts aren’t just written, they
        compute. This isn’t your regular “dear diary” blog. It’s a fusion of
        brain meets bytes, logic meets life, and code meets curiosity.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I’m Raman Bhardwaj, a Computer Science student at ABES Engineering
        College. I spend most of my time untangling logic puzzles, building web
        projects, and diving headfirst into the fascinating world of Machine
        Learning. When I’m not coding, you might find me strumming my guitar,
        overthinking life, or trying to beat my own record in competitive
        programming.

      <h2>🌱 Why Blogorithm?</h2>
      <p>
        The name Blogorithm comes from a mix of “Blog” and “Algorithm” — because
        that’s what my mind is constantly doing: solving, looping, optimizing.
        This blog is my attempt to make sense of the chaos — one post, one bug
        fix, one breakthrough at a time.

        So whether you're here to learn, vibe, or just scroll through the mind
        of a CS student trying to navigate the matrix — welcome aboard.
